1 What is a package?
====================

- tool interfaces are XML files
	- interfaces are parsed by vanda-studio to provide tool nodes (in the gui)

- tool packages are archived (.tar.gz) folders
	- tool packages are used to run the workflows
	- the folder must at least contain the files
		- install.bash
			- install.bash must contain id, varname, version, binpath and a function install_me
			- install_me is provided with the target path for binaries in the first command line argument and should take care of downloading, compiling and installing the needed binaries
		- func.bash
			- func.bash is parsed by vanda-studio according to the interface in charge, look at some code for further insights
	- the folder may contain additional files needed by install_me
